Project: UOS_Netflix_Python<br>
Description: This project holds a list of netflix's titles and is developed by students from the University of Suffolk. Here, we help explain if there is any correlation between ratings and countries, how many movies and shows each country makes, if netflix has more shows than movies and so much more. Python is the coding language of choice to help explain these answers<br>
