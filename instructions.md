## Instructions

Welcome to the Netflix database repo. Your goal is to complete all of the issues outlined in the issues tab of this repo.

Don't forget to add your details to the contributors file when your done!


#### Background
databaseImporter.py imports the netlfix database (.csv file) stored in the "database" directory in the repo. The db is then returned as a Pandas Dataframe, if you've never used the Pandas library before we recommend visiting https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/default.asp  for some guidance. A couple of the issues require the use of graphs to display your findings, as an easy start the use of the Matplotlib library is good (Quick help: https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_intro.asp) alternatively if you are more web centric then building a web app using HTML, CSS and javascript with a Python Flask (or Django) backend is totally awesome as well.

Rules:
1) databaseImporter.py may NOT be modified in any 
3) Clone main.py as a starting base for your solution
4) More than one person can publish solutions to this problem
5) Your are more than welcome to copy code, so long as you can explain how it works!!
6) If you get stuck, Google it before asking us!! 

Please add your answers to the "src" directory with the filename "UOS_ID-ISSUE_NAME.py"
